              End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception
              and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry.
              However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may
              compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs,
              particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential
              safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>
              To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, <b>Argus</b>, to mitigate the
              driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an
              ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever
              the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus
              with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated
              that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the
              ADS by up to <b>150.30%</b> on average, and preventing up to <b>64.38%</b> of the violations, with little
              additional time overhead.
            </p>
            <p>
              The paper has been submitted to ASE 2025.

                Argus comprises three components, i.e., the Takeover Gate, the Hazard Monitor and the Hazard Mitigator.
                Every trajectory generated by the ADS passes through the Takeover Gate, a component responsible for
                dynamic control switching between the ADS and the Hazard Mitigator that is built upon the intelligent
                driver model. The Takeover Gate leverages three takeover buffers and one recovery buffer, all maintained
                by the Hazard Monitor, to determine whether a given trajectory is safe for execution by a takeover and
                recovery mechanism. If the EGO vehicle (i.e., the vehicle controlled by the ADS) is deemed unsafe,
                control is taken over by the Hazard Mitigator for hazard mitigation, and is only returned to the ADS
                once safety is re-established.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have implemented a prototype of Argus with 6,709 lines of Python code. The prototype of Argus and

                We choose three state-of-the-art models, which are the most representative end-to-end ADSs, as our targets. All the three ADSs are initially trained with the Bench2Drive training set. Moreover, we adopt a widely used approach, BEVFormer, which aggregates multiview camera inputs to construct the surrounding environment of the ADS.

                perception. Please refer to the paper for details.

              <p>
                Bench2Drive is a CARLA benchmark proposed by the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03877"
                  target="_blank">Bench2Drive: Towards Multi-Ability Benchmarking of Closed-Loop End-To-End Autonomous
                  Driving</a>. It consists of 220 very short (~150m) routes split across all towns with 1 safety
                critical scenario in each route. To give a rough estimate, it takes around ~4 days to evaluate one ADS
                on Bench2Drive with 4xRTX 3090. For more details on how to aggregate the results, see the <a
                  href="https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive" target="_blank">Bench2Drive</a>.

                <a href="https://leaderboard.carla.org/" target="_blank">The CARLA leaderboard 2.0 validation routes</a>
                is a set of 20 long (~12 km) routes in Town 13. While driving along the routes, the agent has to solve
                around 90 safety critical scenarios per route consisting of 21 different types (38 counting variations).
                Due to the length of the routes as well as the large number of scenarios per route, the scores on this
                benchmark are much lower than on Bench2Drive and other benchmarks.
